Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Numerical summaries; measures of center and variability; graphical methods; data visualization; exploratory data analysis workflow. Probability Concepts and Random Variables Basic probability rules; discrete and continuous random variables; common distributions; expectation and variance. Sampling Distributions and Simulation Concept of sampling distributions; Central Limit Theorem; simulation‑based illustration; intuition for confidence levels and statistical power. Statistical Inference I: Estimation and Confidence Intervals Point estimation; confidence intervals for means and proportions; interpretation and limitations; assumptions and robustness. Statistical Inference II: Hypothesis Testing Null and alternative hypotheses; test statistics; p‑values; Type I/II errors; power considerations and sample size intuition. Inference for Two Populations Two‑sample CIs and tests; paired designs; comparing means and variances; parametric vs. nonparametric choices. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) One‑way ANOVA; model formulation; assumptions; multiple comparisons; practical interpretation and reporting. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) Incorporating quantitative covariates; adjusted means; interpretation; assumption checks and diagnostics. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Least squares estimation; interpretation of coefficients; model fit; inference for regression parameters. Regression Diagnostics and Model Assessment Residual analysis; outliers and influence; multicollinearity; remedial measures (transformations, variable selection). Logistic Regression and Categorical Data Analysis Binary response models; odds, odds ratios, and log‑odds; goodness‑of‑fit; interpreting software output. Nonparametric Methods and Alternatives Rank‑based tests and other nonparametric procedures; when and why to choose nonparametric approaches. Experimental Design and Model Selection Principles of randomization, blocking, replication; power and sample size concepts; model selection strategies; reproducibility. Integration, Applications, and Communication of Results Case studies with real datasets; end‑to‑end analysis; ethical considerations; transparent reporting; course review. 1.2 Topical Learning Outcomes (Aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy) Topic Bloom’s Level Learning Outcome Descriptive Statistics Understand / Apply Summarize and visualize datasets using appropriate numerical and graphical descriptive measures. Probability Concepts Understand Explain fundamental probability concepts and their role in statistical modeling and inference. Sampling Distributions Analyze Analyze sampling variability and illustrate key ideas via simulation. Confidence Intervals Apply / Analyze Construct and interpret confidence intervals; assess assumptions and practical implications. Hypothesis Testing Analyze / Evaluate Evaluate hypotheses using appropriate tests and interpret results in context. Two‑Sample Inference Apply / Analyze Compare two populations using parametric and nonparametric procedures. ANOVA / ANCOVA Analyze Analyze group differences with ANOVA/ANCOVA, incorporating covariates where appropriate. Linear Regression Apply / Analyze Develop and interpret simple and multiple linear regression models. Model Diagnostics Evaluate Assess model assumptions; identify influence and multicollinearity; implement remedial actions. Logistic Regression Analyze Model binary outcomes; interpret odds ratios and fitted model diagnostics. Nonparametric Methods Evaluate Justify and apply nonparametric alternatives when assumptions are violated. Experimental Design Create / Evaluate Design and critique basic experiments (randomization, blocking, replication). Statistical Software (R) Apply / Create Use R to perform analyses, run simulations, interpret output, and communicate results clearly.
