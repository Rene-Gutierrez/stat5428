# Observational and Experimental Studies

## Introduction

Reliable statistical inference depends critically on the quality and structure of
the data collected. This chapter introduces two major frameworks for gathering
data: **surveys** and **experimental studies**. These methods differ in their level
of control, susceptibility to bias, and the strength of the conclusions permitted.

This chapter corresponds to the *Data* stage of the course workflow:
**collecting, describing data, understanding structure, and identifying intrinsic properties before modeling.**

## Surveys

Surveys are systematic procedures for obtaining information from a sample that
represents a broader population. Effective survey design minimizes bias and
ensures appropriate representation.

### Populations and Sampling Frames

- **Population:** the complete set of units of interest.  
- **Sampling frame:** the operational list from which the sample is drawn.

A mismatch between population and frame leads to **coverage error**. 

### Sampling Methods

#### Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
Every subset of a given size has an equal chance of being selected.  
Advantages:
- Unbiased representation. We will see what do we mean by this later. 
- Straightforward design and analysis.


#### Stratified Sampling
The population is divided into homogeneous groups (*strata*), and SRS is applied within each.
- Reduces sampling variability  
- Ensures representation of important subpopulations


#### Cluster Sampling
Naturally occurring groups (clusters) are sampled instead of individuals.
- Efficient for large geographic populations  
- Requires careful design to ensure representativeness  

#### Systematic Sampling
Select every *kth* element after a random start.
- Easy to implement  
- Sensitive to hidden periodic patterns  

### Sources of Survey Bias

#### Selection Bias
The sample differs systematically from the population.

#### Nonresponse Bias
Failure to obtain measurements from selected units creates distortion.

#### Response Bias
Arises from poor question wording, respondent discomfort, or interviewer influence.

### Questionnaire Design Principles

- Use clear, neutral language  
- Avoid leading or double‑barreled questions  
- Choose appropriate measurement scales:
  - Nominal  
  - Ordinal  
  - Interval  
  - Ratio

## Experimental Studies

Experiments involve deliberate manipulation of conditions to identify causal effects.
They provide control over sources of variability through specific design features.

### Key Components of Experimental Design

#### Experimental Units
Entities to which treatments are applied.

#### Treatments and Control
Interventions or conditions imposed on units; control group provides a baseline.

#### Random Assignment
Distributes potential confounders across treatment groups.

#### Replication
Multiple units exposed to each treatment enable the estimation of experimental variability.

#### Blocking
Grouping similar units to reduce the influence of nuisance factors.

### Confounding

A confounding variable affects both treatment assignment and response, obscuring
causal relationships.  
Good experimental design aims to reduce confounding through:
- Randomization  
- Control  
- Proper blocking

## Observational vs Experimental Studies

### Comparative Characteristics

| Feature | Observational Study | Experimental Study |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Researcher control | None | High |
| Confounding | Often present | Reduced |
| Causal claims | Weak | Strong |
| Difficulty | Usually easier to conduct | May be expensive or unethical |

### Interpretational Considerations

Observational studies support **associational** conclusions.  
Experiments support **causal** conclusions, conditional on valid design.

## Data Quality and Measurement

### Validity and Reliability

#### Validity
Whether measurement reflects the concept intended.

#### Reliability
Consistency of repeated measurements under identical conditions.

### Sources of Variability

- Natural biological or environmental variation  
- Measurement error  
- Experimental or observational conditions  
- Sampling variability  

Reducing uncontrolled variation increases the precision and reliability of statistical findings.

## Summary

This chapter establishes essential principles for gathering high‑quality data.
Surveys and experiments differ in control structure, design complexity, and inferential capability, but both aim to produce data suitable for statistical reasoning.

In the next chapter, we transition to **Data Modeling**, where probability is introduced as a generative mechanism to describe theoretical data behavior.
