5. **Statistical Inference I: Estimation and Confidence Intervals**  
   Point estimation; confidence intervals for means and proportions; interpretation and limitations; assumptions and robustness.

6. **Statistical Inference II: Hypothesis Testing**  
   Null and alternative hypotheses; test statistics; p‑values; Type I/II errors; power considerations and sample size intuition.

7. **Inference for Two Populations**  
   Two‑sample CIs and tests; paired designs; comparing means and variances; parametric vs. nonparametric choices.

12. **Logistic Regression and Categorical Data Analysis**  
    Binary response models; odds, odds ratios, and log‑odds; goodness‑of‑fit; interpreting software output.

13. **Nonparametric Methods and Alternatives**
